# Customer Loyalty Scheme

#### In this project a decision had to be made whether to keep the current loyalty scheme or not - several factors were taken into consideration which were explored deeply wihtin the project. As for our choice we decided to restructure the entire ranking system by redefining tiers and changing the respective perks - the main problems were first highlighted and recommendations were made to mitigate and elimiate these issues. ####

Our aim was to analyse consumer behaviour over the last 6 months and then extrapolate this out to the rest of the business. Using already exsiting analysis within customer, marketing, product and web data we decided to expand by incorporating insights from the customer loyalty scheme. We ultimately went with the below three KPIs to study to get a general idea of the performance of the original loyalty scheme:

* Average Profits by Tier
* Coupon Usage
* Conversion Rates

As we understand that fashion e-commerce loyalty schemes **DO** work (as mentioned in this [article](https://whitelabel-loyalty.com/blog/loyalty-industry-insight/benefits-of-loyalty-programs?utm_medium=ppc&utm_term=benefits%20of%20loyalty%20programs&utm_campaign=Non+Brand+-+Blog+(UK)&utm_source=adwords&hsa_grp=142881141813&hsa_ad=632591862127&hsa_net=adwo) along with added benefits, we went with the choice of desinging a new customer loyalty scheme to bring in more value from customers to the company.
